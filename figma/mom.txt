3.	File Versions: 
o	Retain versions of files for the same quarter and allow viewing history of documents.  
Next Steps: 
•	Focus on creating the execution dashboard and task-level screens for the MVP.

•	Start the build process for file upload functionality and other basic features. 


User stories> 
Task Management Dashboard

Create a user management dashboard with tab-based filtering and a task table.

tasks categorized under different statuses (Pending, Active, Completed, Upcoming),

I can easily track progress, assign tasks, and monitor workflow descriptions in a structured and intuitive interface.

Tab Navigation
   - The dashboard must display four tabs at the top: Pending, Active, Completed, and Upcoming.
   - Clicking a tab should filter the table to show only tasks with the corresponding status.
   - The active tab should be visually highlighted.

Task Table
   - Below the tabs, a table should be displayed with the following columns:
     - Workflow Name
     - Task Name
     - Status
     - Assign
     - Description
   - The table should dynamically update based on the selected tab.
   - Each row should represent a task with its associated metadata.
   - Users should be able to click on a task row to view more details
